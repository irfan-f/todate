## Learned User Preferences

- Only allow scrolling inside explicit scroll containers (timeline, modals, filters, forms); disable document-level/page scrolling.

## Learned Workspace Facts

- Before review-changes: run **prepare-for-review** (deslop, then rework-commit-history) so the branch is clean and commits are reviewable.
- Create a new branch before making file changes (see branch-first rule); name branches like `feature/short-name` or `improvement/short-name`.
