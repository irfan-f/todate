description: When to edit .gitignore; only for new local/sensitive paths not already covered
---

# .gitignore

Only add or change `.gitignore` when you introduce a **new** local/sensitive file or dir whose path is **not** already covered (e.g. under `.cursor/` or `secrets/` is usually already ignored).

When adding an entry: use the **highest parent path**; **do not repeat** or overlap (e.g. one `.cursor/` not `.cursor/rules/` and `.cursor/hooks/`). Prefer writing local/sensitive output under existing ignored paths (`.cursor/`, `secrets/`, `*.local`, root `.env`) so you rarely need a new entry.

Must ignore if missing: `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.pem`, `secrets/`, `.cursor/`, `AGENTS.md`.
