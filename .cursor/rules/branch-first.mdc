# Branch before making changes

**Before making file changes** (new features, refactors, improvements, fixes), **create a new branch** from the current base (e.g. `main`). Do not start editing or adding files until the branch exists.

**Branch naming:** Human-readable, generic but descriptive. Use the pattern **`type/short-description`** (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces).

- **Types:** `feature`, `improvement`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, etc.
- **Description:** Short and clear (e.g. `persistent-data`, `structure-changes`, `auth-hook`).

**Examples:** `feature/persistent-data`, `improvement/structure-changes`, `fix/date-timezone`, `refactor/timeline-filters`.

If the user is already on an appropriate branch and has not asked to create one, you may continue on that branch; otherwise create a new one before changing files.
