# Package-specific rules

When the user or the task **references a specific package, library, or framework** (e.g. by name, docs link, or "use Tailwind", "use React Router"): **prompt the user once** to search for and add a good set of rules or instructions for that package (e.g. from official docs, Core Concepts, or best practices). Offer to draft a concise rule from the docs if they want. Do not assume package-specific conventions without that step.
